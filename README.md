# QCP + QBronze Workshop: Personal Repository

This repository contains my course materials, personal notes, and coding exercises for the **Quantum Computing and Programming (QCP)** workshop, specifically following the **QBronze** curriculum organized by **QWorld** (QIran).

## 📖 About the Course

**QBronze** is an introductory level quantum workshop series designed to teach the basics of quantum computing and quantum programming. The core philosophy of the course is "learning by doing," utilizing Jupyter notebooks and the **Qiskit** framework to provide hands-on experience.

### Key Topics Covered:

-   **Basics of Classical Systems:** Probabilistic bits, coin-flipping, biased coins, and correlation.
-   **Basics of Quantum Systems:** Quantum programs as circuits, registers, gates, and measurements.
-   **Quantum Operators:** Operations on a single quantum bit.
-   **Entanglement:** Quantum correlation and basic protocols (Superdense Coding, Teleportation).
-   **Quantum Search:** Implementation of Grover's Algorithm.
    

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into numbered directories (e.g., `01-...`, `02-...`) that follow the chronological progression of the workshop modules.

Each numbered folder represents a specific session or topic and typically contains:
-   **Lecture Notes:** Introductory materials and theoretical background.
-   **Jupyter Notebooks:** Hands-on tutorials and source code.
-   **Exercises & Solutions:** My personal implementations and answers to the workshop tasks.
    

The folders are ordered sequentially, starting with prerequisites (Python and Linear Algebra) and moving through the QBronze quantum curriculum.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
-   **Language:** Python 3
-   **Framework:** Qiskit (IBM Quantum)
-   **Environment:** Jupyter Notebooks
    

## 📜 License & Credits
-   **Course Material:** The original educational notebooks and curriculum are developed by [**QWorld**](https://qworld.net/ "null").
-   **My Contributions:** Solutions to exercises and personal practice codes contained herein are my own work.

_This repository serves as a personal archive for my learning journey through the QBronze certification._
